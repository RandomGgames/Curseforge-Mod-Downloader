# Curseforge Mod Downloader
A script that automatically downloads the latest version of mods into as many directories as you'd like! Perfect for keeping the mods in multiple game instances spanning different versions updated.

# How to use
- Download ZIP onto your PC.
- Extract contents into a folder
- Run the install_required_packages.bat (which just installs python "requests")
- Open the "Manager Config.json" file and configure settings
- Run "Updater.py"
